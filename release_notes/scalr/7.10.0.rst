Announcements:
--------------
Ubuntu 18.04 Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Ubuntu 18.04 support will be introduced in Scalr 7.10.0 and Scalarizr 6.7.4.

The following software automation tools will be supported:

* Chef
* Ansible

The following built-in automation will not be supported:

* Apache
* Tomcat
* Nginx
* HAProxy
* MySQL
* Percona
* MariaDB
* RabbitMQ
* Redis
* Memcached


Users can still install the platforms above using orchestration scripts or our integration with configuration tools, but it will no longer be included in Scalr Built-In Automation.

.. note::

   June 29th, 2018: All major OS releases will no longer include support for the built-in automation noted above. All existing OS releases will have support for the built-in automation until their EOL.

Users & Teams Refactoring
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**What is changing?**

In Scalr 7.10.0 we have refactored the way users and teams are created and stored in Scalr, they will now be objects at the global scope as opposed to the account scope.

**Why are these changes happening?**

Previous to 7.10.0, if a user was part of one more or more accounts then they had a user object created for each account. In the new model, everyone will have one user that is shared across accounts and environments.

**What will be different for me?**

* If you are the Scalr (global) admin, you can now see and manage all users at the global scope.
* If you are an account admin, nothing will change, you will still be able to add users and teams at the account scope.
* If you are a Scalr (global) admin you will now be able to use your LDAP credentials to log into Scalr. To update users, please remove the user and re-add them to force LDAP credential to be used going forward.
